Speech recognition
==================

Speech recognition is a very important part of the Aurora project.
We have tried the following libraries for speech recognition:

* Google Cloud Speech
* CMU Sphinx

Now our application is still not developed enough to decide which of
them better suits our needs. Further tests are required.
