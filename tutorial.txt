In this tutorial we gonna

> Create 3 nodes nodeA, nodeB, nodeC
> Connect them into a group
> Add voice command 'light' on nodeA which when heard will be sent to nodeA and nodeB which are gonna run light script
> Run command light from local cli interface on nodeA
> Run local light command from CLI interface on nodeB, nodeC
> Do the same from web interface??

Clone repo
create & activate virtualenv
pip install -r requirements.txt

create directories nodeA, nodeB, nodeC
copy config.yaml and certs directory into each of them
in each config change port to a different number (ex 8080 8081 8082)
in each config change name to this node's name
in each certs directory run this command with this node's name and ip address
./generate_cert.sh nodeA 127.0.0.1
Just press enter on all questions

In each folder run python3 -m node

Rach node should start and you should see the line
Local password is: <local pass>

Now you can make curl requests to nodes with curl ex
curl https://127.0.0.1:8080/net/groups --user local:<local pass> --insecure

Or with certificate validation
curl https://127.0.0.1:8080/net/groups --cacert certs/nodeA.crt --user local:<local pass>
